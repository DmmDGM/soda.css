# Soda.css

## Description

"Hai~ Dis is soda.css! I made it myself! :3"

Soda.css is a simple CSS default styling template without the complexity or bloaty-ness of other CSS frameworks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This means that Soda.css will directly style your HTML page.
> It is meant to be used as a starting template, not as a CSS library.

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> I guess just use the pre-releases?

## CSS vs SCSS

Some front-end frameworks do not allow you to use both CSS and SCSS in your projects. If you prefer SCSS, you can use the SCSS option to avoid the preprocessor complaining.

They are literally the same file anyway but just renamed.
